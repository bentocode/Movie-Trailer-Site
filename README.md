# Movie Trailer Website version 1

## Description
This project generates a webpage that displays movie titles and corresponding poster art. Users can view each movie's trailer by clicking on the poster art.

## Tools
The code to create the list of movies is written in Python while the code to generate the webpage is HTML5 compliant with [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com) and the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) javascript library.

## Background
This project was developed by Benjamin Coate ([@bentocode](https://github.com/bentocode)) May 2017 as a requirement of the [Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

## Requirements
In order to run the code, you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7 + installed locally.

## Code Execution
Clone the repository and execute entertainment_center.py to view the generated webpage.

## Future Development
This iteration of the project was designed to fulfill only the basic requirements of the course and future development is anticipated. Future iterations will include the ability to accept user input and search for movies dynamically using an API instead of only displaying hard coded options.
